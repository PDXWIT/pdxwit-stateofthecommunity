        <h1>2020 State of the Community</h1>
          <div>
            <p class="dark">Each year, PDX Women in Tech (PDXWIT) conducts the State of the Community survey to capture data about the tech industry. Our goal is to quantify the depth and breadth of lived experience for people working in tech, and identify themes that need to be addressed in our collective journey towards equity in the workplace.</p>
            <p class="dark">There was a lot going on when we administered the survey this year: a global pandemic — one that disproportionately affects Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) — a record level of unemployment, and increased direct action for racial justice, to name a few. In hindsight, normally useful survey questions around compensation preferences, work-life balance and general job satisfaction were probably the last things on people’s minds. We predicted that the macro context overwhelming everyone would affect the responses and outcomes of the survey <strong>We had no idea as to the extent.</strong></p>
            <p class="dark">We saw a dramatic drop in the number of survey responses this year: 1138 as opposed to 5186 from last year. We saw a significant drop in the diversity of the participants. While it took a monumental amount of effort to look past the statistical anomaly of this year’s data to glean insights, one thing was clear. People had a lot to say. We even saw glimmers of hope that the industry seems to be making forward progress on a few fronts. We took away many patterns and narratives that should inspire action — action required by both PDXWIT and the tech community at large. Here is a summary of our findings. </p>
            <p class="dark">Terms:</p>
              <ul class="dark">
                <li>BIPOC: Black, Indigenous and People of Color</li>
                <li>LGBTQ+: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender</li>
                <li>Cis or Cisgender: Personal gender identity matches biological sex assigned at birth</li>
                <li>GNC: Gender Nonconforming</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="dark">Share this data broadly, reference it often, and join our movement.</p>

        <h2>Employee Experience </h2>
        <h3>Inclusion, belonging and visibility</h3>
        <p>In 2019, BIPOC respondents described their place of employment as "diverse," "inclusive," "caring," and "improving" at significantly lower rates than white respondents — and described their workplace as “toxic” more often than white respondents.</p>
        <p>In 2020, we explored this toxicity more deeply by looking at different elements that contribute to toxic, exclusive work environments. We found a higher rate of cis women respondents and gender non-conforming folks had negative experiences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>they were told they were too aggressive at work,</li>

        <q>Having ideas ignored/overlooked/unattributed is the biggest problem for marginalized groups in tech because it is not overt and can hide behind many excuses,which make it hard to call out as a real problem. Without recognition for one's ideas and the ability to enact change, it is impossible to become visible in an organization, gain opportunities, and be fairly compensated as a result.</q>

      <h3>Workplace Harassment</h3>
      <p>The majority of respondents feel that employers’ handling of workplace harassment has gotten better over time. 89% of respondents over 55 reported feeling this way. 83% of total respondents shared they are likely to report workplace harassment.</p>
      <p><em>We believe that historically, workplace harassment has gone under-reported, possibly due to embarrassment, fear of retaliation or an expectation that reporting it won’t have an impact. This year’s data point is promising, and tells us that the more we openly talk about workplace harassment, the more likely people are to report the behavior and employers will address it properly. We took a deep dive into workplace harassment in our <a href="https://stateofthecommunity.pdxwit.org/2018/">2018 State of the Community Survey</a> analysis.</em></p>

        <h3>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)</h3>
        <p>Last year we looked closely at whether DEI initiatives were actually successful and resonating with BIPOC and GNC, populations these groups should ideally be prioritizing. Unfortunately, we found that <strong class="color-emphasis-lime">white cisgender individuals</strong> (a.k.a. not BIPOC or GNC folks) <strong class="color-emphasis-lime">were far more pleased with the DEI efforts</strong> at their company than their BIPOC and/or GNC counterparts.</p>
        <p>We are seeing potential indicators that more BIPOC respondents would recommend folks from underrepresented communities to join their company (71% of respondents said yes to this question in 2020, compared to 30% in 2019). This is a dramatic increase, but the lack of BIPOC responses this year compared to last must be considered when comparing these two datasets.</p>
        <p>While there seems to be some improvement with respondents explicitly saying they would recommend underrepresented communities to join their company, we still see that twice the rate of <strong class="color-emphasis-lime">BIPOC participants</strong> (15% in 2020 vs 7% in 2019) <strong class="color-emphasis-lime">would not recommend</strong> folks from underrepresented communities to join their company, indicating that there is <strong class="color-emphasis-lime">more work to be done</strong> on the inclusion front.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
              <p class="action-section col-12">With an over-representation of cisgender white women in the survey, this year’s dataset is not representative of the demographics we aim to support the most. It has further validated the hypothesis we hold as an organization that DEI efforts, including those advanced by PDXWIT, are continuing to serve those who experience the least hardship in the industry and not those who need it the most.</p>
              <p>One of the biggest takeaways from this year’s experience is that PDXWIT and tech companies at large need to <strong class="color-emphasis-lime">stop looking for quick and easy fixes to solve the lack of diversity, equity and inclusion in tech</strong>. We need to become more introspective, open to community feedback (particularly from the communities we wish to serve), and redefine our metrics of success.</p>
              <p>We need to be comfortable with adjusting our plans, taking our time and not rushing for outcomes in the way we have in the past. Urgency is a trait of white supremacy and while we exist in a fast-moving industry, we have learned that progress around equity and inclusion takes time and often is without immediate tangible rewards. </p>
              <p>We at PDXWIT are more committed than ever to live up to our mission to dismantle inequities and pave pathways for marginalized folks to enter, stay and thrive in tech. In addition to <a href="https://www.pdxwit.org/showing-our-work">showing our work</a>, here are a few actions we have taken in 2020 and will continue to build on in 2021 in response to this survey data:</p>
